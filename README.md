CC* Integration-Large: Q-Factor: A Framework to Enable Ultra High-Speed Data Transfer Optimization based on Real-Time Network State Information provided by Programmable Data Planes

Q-Factor leverages programmable network devices with the In-band Network Telemetry (INT) application and delivers a software solution to process in-band measurements at the end hosts. Using Q-Factor on Data Transfer Nodes (DTN)s, TCP/IP parameters will be configured according to temporal network characteristics, such as round-trip time, network utilization, and network congestion. This tuning is expected to result in increased network utilization, shorter flow completion times, and significantly fewer packet drops caused by network buffers overflow. Additionally, Q-Factor is geared to save host memory by tailoring kernel parameters and buffers to optimal sizes.

Q-Factor targets a timely issue in communication networks: underutilization of ultra high-speed networks for science workflows. In order to keep scientific progress unconstrained, future science workflows need to support emerging data-intensive science experiments (e.g., the Vera Rubin Observatory, High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider) where data generation grows significantly, reaching exabytes of traffic each year. Results of this project will also allow better understanding of optimal buffer sizes of network devices for huge flows and the interaction of various congestion control algorithms.
